# LocalCP4PINN

## Abstract
**LocalCP4PINN** is a framework for **local conformal prediction (Local CP)**, a distribution-free calibration method designed to quantify *spatially adaptive uncertainty* in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) when solving forward problems.

For the detailed algorithm of the local conformal prediction, please take a look at the article below. Please remember to cite the paper if the algorithm helps :)

## Example: 2D Allenâ€“Cahn Equation
The figure below illustrates **geometric-distance-based uncertainty calibration** for the 2D Allenâ€“Cahn equation under various heteroskedastic noise patterns, at a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$.  
Dashed lines mark irregular, noisy regions.  

- **Rows:** Different noise patterns  
- **Columns:**  
  1. Referenced true absolute error distribution
  2. Baseline PINN interval width  
  3. CP interval width  
  4. Local CP interval width

## Repository Structure & Usage
Each Jupyter notebook corresponds to a numerical experiment reported in the paper.  
ðŸ‘‰ We recommend starting with the **1D Poisson equation** example to become familiar with the repository structure and workflow.

### Environment
- Recommended: **Python 3.10.17**
