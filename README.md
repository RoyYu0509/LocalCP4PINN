## Reading Guide
Each Jupyter notebook in this repository corresponds to a numerical experiment presented in the paper.
You can start with the simplest 1D Poisson example to get yourself familiar with the structure of this repository.

***NOTE:***
- The local CP examples are not yet updated in the article. For more information, please refer to the updated article.
- Use Python 3.10.17.
