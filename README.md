# LocalCP4PINN

## Abstract
**LocalCP4PINN** is a framework for **local conformal prediction**, a distribution-free conformal calibration method designed to quantify local uncertainty in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) when solving the forward problem.

### UQ on 2D Allen-Cahn Example
Geometric-distance PINN uncertainty calibration for the 2D Allenâ€“Cahn equation under different heteroskedastic noise patterns. The irregular noisy regions are distinguished with dashed lines.
- **Row:** Different noise patterns. 
- **Column:** The true absolute-error distributions and the interval widths for the baseline model, CP, and local CP at $\alpha=0.05$, respectively, from the first column to the fourth column.
